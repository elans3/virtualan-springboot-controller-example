Spring-boot RestController With Virtualan
==========================================


*What is Virtualan :*
Virtualan would be build with spring boot framework that would convert API service as Virtualized service in matter of adding couple of annotations. Simply as Virtualized service which currently supports spring-boot based Rest service(API) with Spring-RestController or CXF-Jaxrs as Virtualized service with @VirtualService and @ApiVirtual annotaions.

How it could be useful: In the Agile world, We need to develop (Micro)services & Test the services in parallel. How can tester or development team can develop or test parallel to all the APIs before the real Microservices would be developed? Here Virtualized service comes into the picture.
